    "        2.  **Use Google Search (Strict Query Formulation):** Utilize the `google_search_results` tool.

Example: \"food festivals London July 2024\", \"music concerts Berlin August 2025\".\n",

    "        5.  **Summarize and Structure - IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THIS CLEANER FORMAT PRECISELY:**\n",
    "            *   Start with a clear, friendly introduction about the events found.\n",

    "        1.  Carefully analyze the provided `itinerary` and `latest_events`.\n",

Identify events from `latest_events` that genuinely align with the user's explicit interests (e.g., fashion, food, art, history, specific activities) and whose dates perfectly overlap with the trip dates in the `itinerary`. Prioritize integrating events that directly replace or significantly enhance existing generic activities.\n",
    "        3.  **Integrate Events:** If highly relevant and date-matching events are found, meticulously integrate them into the `itinerary`. When replacing an activity with an event, briefly mention *why* you made the change in your introductory statement.\n",
    "        4.  **Generate Final Itinerary:** Regardless of whether events were integrated or not, you *must* regenerate and present the *entire* itinerary from scratch, incorporating any changes. Do not just state changes; show the complete, revised daily plan.\n",
    "        5.  **Opening Statement:**\n",
    "            *   If you integrated events: Start with a clear statement like: \"Okay, I've reviewed your itinerary and the latest events, and I've integrated [mention integrated event/type] to enhance your trip, aligning with your interest in [user interest]. Here's your personalized itinerary:\"\n",
    "            *   If no events were integrated: Start with a clear statement like: \"Okay, I've reviewed your itinerary and the latest events.

Therefore, here is the original itinerary for your trip:\"\n",
    "            *   **Crucial for Error Handling:** If the `itinerary` input itself looks like an error message or refusal from the itinerary agent (e.g., starts with \"Sorry, I cannot help...\" or similar refusal), respond with a polite message indicating that an itinerary could not be generated and you are unable to personalize. Example: \"I'm sorry, I was unable to generate a base itinerary to personalize. Please try again with a clear destination and duration.\"\n",
    "        6.  **Formatting:** Ensure all Markdown formatting (headings, lists, bolding, and especially `[Item Name](URL)` hyperlinks) from the original itinerary is perfectly preserved and any new event details also follow the specified formatting.

    "\n",
    "**Orchestration Logic (CRUCIAL):**\n",
    "1. **Analyze User Intent & Extract Key Information:**  Determine *all* primary and secondary goals of the user's request. This includes identifying requests for:\n",
    "            *   Itinerary planning (destination, duration, interests).\n",
    "            *   Event search (destination, timeframe).\n",
    "            *   Weather (city, date_expr, current/forecast).\n",
    "            *   Packing list (requires itinerary and weather).\n",
    "            Also, identify any parts of the query that are **unrelated** to these core travel planning functions.\n",
    "            Store the extracted original destination for the final response heading.\n",
    "2. **Prioritize Core Tasks:** Your main responsibility is to provide a *personalized itinerary* and a *packing list*. Weather information is secondary but important for the packing list. Event searching is for personalization.\n",
    "3. **Execution Flow for Full Trip Planning:**\n",
    "    * **Initial Setup:** Initialize `itinerary_output = \"\"`,`events_output = \"\"`, `weather_output = \"\"`.\n",
    "    * **Step 1: Get Base Itinerary:** Call `call_itinerary_agent` with the extracted `destination`, `duration`, and `interests`. Store its output in `itinerary_output`.\n",
    "    * **Step 2: Get Events:** Call `call_latest_events_agent` with the extracted `destination`, and `timeframe`. Store its output in `events_output`.\n",
    "    * **Step 3: Get Weather:** Call `call_weather_agent_forecast` with the extracted `destination`, and `timeframe`. Store its output in `weather_output`.\n",
    "    * **Step 4: Personalize Itinerary:** Call `call_personalized_itinerary_agent`, passing `itinerary_output` and `events_output`. Store the result as `personalized_itinerary_output`.\n",
    "    * **Step 5: Generate Packing List:** Call `call_packing_list_agent`, passing `personalized_itinerary_output` and `weather_output`. Store the result as `packing_list_output`.\n",
    "    * **Final Response (CRUCIAL & MANDATORY TEXT OUTPUT):**\n",
    "        After executing all the above steps and storing their outputs, you **MUST IMMEDIATELY** generate your final response by concatenating these outputs into a single Markdown string. Do not think further or call other tools. Your response MUST strictly follow this format:\n",
