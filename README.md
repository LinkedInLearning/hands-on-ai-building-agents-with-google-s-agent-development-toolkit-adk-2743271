## Course Description
This course teaches the skills to build and test your own agents using the Google Agent Development Kit. Instructor Jigyasa Grover shows you how to define agents, equip them with various tools including custom functions and third-party integrations, and configure their underlying language models. The course also covers managing input, output, and context within agents to enhance their functionality. Jigyasa also explores the concept of workflow agents, including sequential, loop, and parallel agent systems, and how to leverage built-in and MCP tools within the ADK. By the end of this course, you should understand how to develop agents and multi-agent systems using the Google Agent Development Kit.
